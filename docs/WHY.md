## Why TinyString?

**Go's WebAssembly potential is incredible**, but traditional applications face a critical challenge: **massive binary sizes** that make web deployment impractical.

### The Problem
Every Go project needs string manipulation, type conversion, and error handling - but importing standard library packages (`fmt`, `strings`, `strconv`, `errors`) creates significant binary bloat that hurts:

- 🌐 **Web app performance** - Slow loading times and poor user experience
- � **Edge deployment** - Resource constraints on small devices  
- 🚀 **Distribution efficiency** - Large binaries for simple operations

### The Solution
TinyString replaces multiple standard library packages with **lightweight, manual implementations** that deliver:

- 🏆 **Up to smaller binaries** - Dramatic size reduction for WebAssembly
- ✅ **Full TinyGo compatibility** - No compilation issues or warnings
- 🎯 **Predictable performance** - No hidden allocations or overhead
- 🔧 **Familiar API** - Drop-in replacement for standard library functions
